1. Fix so copy dont show http --> http://registry.ra.se:5002/airiksarkivet/htrflow:v0.1.0 -->  registry.ra.se:5002/airiksarkivet/htrflow:v0.1.0
2. Fix so delete button works. --> The delete button should also make sure so that the table and total size is updated.
3. Ensure so that total size actually show the real size. The layers are counted multiple times, since if i image the layer are still existing another
--> Perhaps take the set of all layers hash and afterwards count all the layers size.
